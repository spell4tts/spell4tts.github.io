    <h2>Abstract:</h2>

    <p>Ensuring accurate pronunciation is critical for high-quality text-to-speech (TTS). This typically requires a phoneme-based pronunciation dictionary, which is labour-intensive and costly to create. Previous work has suggested using graphemes instead of phonemes, but the inevitable pronunciation errors that occur cannot be fixed, since there is no longer a pronunciation dictionary. As an alternative, speech-based self-supervised learning (SSL) models have been proposed for pronunciation control, but these models are computationally expensive to train, produce representations that are not easily interpretable, and capture unwanted non-phonemic information. To address these limitations, we propose Spell4TTS, a novel method that generates acoustically-informed word spellings. Spellings are both interpretable and easily edited. The method could be applied to any existing pre-built TTS system. Our experiments show that the method creates word spellings that lead to fewer TTS pronunciation errors than the original spellings, or an Automatic Speech Recognition baseline. Additionally, we observe that pronunciation can be further enhanced by ranking candidates in the space of SSL speech representations, and by incorporating Human-in-the-Loop screening over the top-ranked spellings devised by our method. By working with spellings of words (composed of characters), the method lowers the entry barrier for TTS system development for languages with limited pronunciation resources. It should reduce the time and cost involved in creating and maintaining pronunciation dictionaries.</p>
